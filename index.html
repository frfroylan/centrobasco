			<h2>About us... </h2>
			<p>Open since 1940, Centro Basco is the oldest Basque Restaurant in the Chino Valley of Southern California! It continues to be family owned and operated by the Berterretche Family since 1970. The Basque lands stretch along the Pyrennes mountains in the Southern region of France and the Northern region of Spain. The home town of owner Monique Berterretche can be found just outside of St. Jean Pied de Port, France. It is from here the Berterretche family has brought the unique dining experience to the Chino Valley. If one has ever traveled to the Basque Country, they are quite familiar with the friendliness and sense of family that is experienced amongst the Basque people. It is this atmosphere that makes the outing to Centro Basco a unique, memorable, and cherished experience! </p>
			
			<p>Centro Basco offers two dining experiences. Please check our hours carefully under the Menu link as they can seem confusing. In the spirit of the Basque tradition, we offer Family-Style dining in which everyone sits together at long tables in the Red Room or the Mus Room. Family-Style dining offers multiple courses, such as sourdough bread and blue cheese, homemade soup du jour, salad, and then the special of the day which typically consists of two meat choices and its complement vegetable. The Family-Style Menu offers special dishes not found on the menu such as oxtail stew, rabbit, blood sausage, and many more! Accompanied by all you can drink house wine and the friendship of new and familiar faces, Centro Basco's Family Style will leave you with the warmth of the Basques!</p>
			
			<p>Centro Basco also offers a traditional dining room where guests can choose their preferred entre from our Menu. This menu has many choices ranging from various choices of lamb, veal, fish, and beef. Check our Menu link for a closer look! We have two full cocktail bars and offer various wines and beer at great prices. Also, our restaurant is the perfect place to host large parties and banquets.</p>
